Version 0.2

- The list of file extensions which will be served to the KiSS is no longer
  hardcoded, but can be specified using -e ext1:ext2:....
- .ogg extension added to the list of acceptable extensions.
- Added security: files outside the paths specified will no longer be served.
- Fixed a bug in the GET command (it would close the socket on wrong occasions);
  this prevents the long delay after playing content.
- Paths which are not configured will yield empty directories now.

Version 0.1
