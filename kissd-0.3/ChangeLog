Version 0.3

- Added subtitles (srt) to the list of acceptable extensions.
- The daemon is now displayable; can be disabled using the -D option.
- Removed an incredibly dumb bug which would cause filed with multiple dots in
  their filename never to be accepted (due to missing strchr -> strrchr change
  while checking for extension, sigh)

Version 0.2

- The list of file extensions which will be served to the KiSS is no longer
  hardcoded, but can be specified using -e ext1:ext2:....
- .ogg extension added to the list of acceptable extensions.
- Added security: files outside the paths specified will no longer be served.
- Fixed a bug in the GET command (it would close the socket on wrong occasions);
  this prevents the long delay after playing content.
- Paths which are not configured will yield empty directories now.

Version 0.1
