The KiSS DP-500 was a nice DVD/AVI/DivX/XviD/MP3/Ogg/etc player, which features an 100baseTX NIC so it can play content directly from your PC.

Unfortunately, KiSS supplies only a Windows-only program for sharing the content, which won't get you very far. The only alternatives I found were [Open DP-500](http://sourceforge.net/projects/open-dp500/) and JLink. However, these programs are all written in Java, which is nice for development but was rather clumsy dependancy-wise for me at the time.

## Features

 * Portable: works on any system which supports POSIX threads
 * Easy to setup: no configuration files, a simple command is enough
 * Daemonizable, which means you won't even notice it is running
